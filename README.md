# Teaching-Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my Web Development Teaching Portfolio! This repository showcases the projects and lessons I've designed to teach basic web development to students in elementary, middle, and high schools. My goal is to make learning web development fun, accessible, and practical by creating hands-on projects that students can relate to and enjoy.

## Projects

### 1. Favorite Recipe Webpage

**Target Audience**: Elementary and Middle School Students

**Description**: 
In this project, students learn the basics of HTML and CSS by creating a webpage to introduce their favorite recipe. They practice structuring content with HTML tags and styling it with CSS to make their webpage visually appealing.

**Skills Covered**:
- HTML basics (headings, paragraphs, lists, images)
- CSS basics (colors, fonts, margins, padding)
- Introduction to web page layout

### 2. Mock Search Engine Site

**Target Audience**: Middle and High School Students

**Description**: 
Students take on a more advanced project by creating a mock version of the Google search homepage. They practice using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to replicate the look and feel of a well-known website. This project emphasizes attention to detail and understanding how real-world sites are constructed.

**Skills Covered**:
- Advanced HTML (forms, inputs, buttons)
- Advanced CSS (flexbox, positioning, responsive design)
- Introduction to JavaScript (handling user input)
